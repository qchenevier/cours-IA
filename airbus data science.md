- Fordism is an attempt to optimize Decisions Quality
- Digitalization aims at increasing:
    - autonomy: improving speed of decision-making
    - rationality: improving quality of decision-making
    for humans, with the help of the relevant machines

# Humans vs Machines

Machine
    High initial cost
    Low marginal cost
    Very fast information processing
    Repetition

NEW ==> master complex cognitive tasks

Human
    Low initial cost
    High marginal cost
    Slow information processing
    Creativity

NEW ==> master rationality & autonomy

# Organization's Digitalization process

What is the proportion of processes inherited from the "phone & paper era" ?

How to digitalize / automatize:
- Processes (Humans & Machines + Information) mapping
- Process digitalization
    3 steps process digitalization:
    - monitor: machines display information about present to let humans take decision
    - predict: machines predict the future to let humans take decision
    - automate: machines know the present & future to decide in place of humans
